# - ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS
# Some operations take a long time, web calls, network IO,
# complex data processing, etc. We don't want to stop everything just
# because one process is taking forever.

# - Concurrency and parallelism is a broad topic
# All languages offer multiple options for managing long running operations
# and Python is no exception. We're going to focus on a common scenario:
# web requests

# - Introducing the asyncio module
# New in Python 3.4, undergoing regular updates
# "Grafts"  asynchronous development into Python
# Streams
# async/await
# Synchronization (locks)
# Exception managements
